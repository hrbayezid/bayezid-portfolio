# Portfolio Data Directory

This directory contains JSON data files for the portfolio application.

## Structure

- `projects.json` - Contains all portfolio projects data
- `skills.json` - Contains all skills data
- `profile.json` - Contains profile information
- `settings.json` - Contains application settings

These files are created and managed by the application when using the GitHub backend integration. 

**Note:** When using GitHub Pages as a backend, the application will read and write JSON files to this directory through the GitHub API.
